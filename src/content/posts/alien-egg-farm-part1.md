## Alien Egg Farm

<p className="">Possibly one of the most far-out locations I've ever been to. The Bisti Badlands are on tribal land and extremely remote. There are no roads. This is a 3.5 mile hike into some of the most extreme landscapes.
</p>

<p className="">It seems like around every corner there is another scene that appears to be from a distant planet. These "alien eggs" are actually weathered limestone.</p>

<p className="letter">Single Shot - No PS - long exposure</p>
