Seeing as this is my frist post !1!, woot, woot!

Sorry, I've always wanted to do that, lol. This piece was completely chosen as First Post because this fantastic show was in a lot of ways the pioneering inspiration that made this site possible. 

So, this is sort of my own tribute to the Great Mystery Science Theater 3000 show.

Enjoy the show!
