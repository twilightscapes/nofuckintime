This was one of my favorite shots from when I was in Dallas. I was lucky enough to get rooftop access to a 36-stpry building right smack dab in the middle of between uptown and downtown districts. 

One of my favorite movies is a great movie about a computer scientist running a virtual reality simulation of 1937 and he becomes the primary suspect when his colleague and mentor is murdered.

Anyways, there is a couple scenes in that movie where the guy drives out into the middle of nowhere in order to prove whether he is living in a simulation or not. I've always been intrigued with this notion and loved this part of the movie. SO, I tried to create my own verion of the end of the line in our simulation called "Life". 

Hope you enjoy.
