<h2 style="font-weight:bold; font-size:125%;">What are VidSocks?</h2>

VidSocks are layered multimedia (including animation, cutouts, video, and audio) crafted together to give the viewer a whole new sensory experience.

VidSocks allow artists, photographers, musicians and other small business to have a BIG presence on the web with a site designed to give every advantage possible to maximizing your artwork and the site's speed and seachability. VidSocks do both, and do it better than anyone else.

We guarantee that the VidSocks platform is faster than any other portfolio/blog website available today. We'll put our site scorecard to the test, check it out for yourself. Does your website come close to our score-topping results out of the box?

<!-- ## With each winning bid, you not only get to take home your new VidSock, but you will also get your very own copy of the <strong>VidSock NFT Marketing Platformâ„¢</strong> to make and market your own VidSocks. -->
